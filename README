fex (file exchange daemon) is a replicating filesystem for
disconnected computers similar to intermezzo (and not so similar to
coda). The main design goal for fex was to provide a system which is
easy to install and configure. Some Features of fex are

   * fex does not need a kernel module, it works with every filesystem

   * fex uses a very simple conflict resolving mechanism (see the
   * manual page fexd(8))

   * fex supports ssh tunneling for connections over the internet

   * fex uses rsync for replicating large files

   * fex adapts to the network speed, and uses compression if
   * neccessary

   * fex runs as a peer to peer system. It can act as server and
   * client.

fex uses the marvelous nmstl library (http://nmstl.sourceforge.net/).
The files in the nmstl, and nmstl_src folders are modified for fex.

	 

>> Requirements
To build fex you will need:
 
  * gcc

  * make

  * librsync (available under http://librsync.sourceforge.net/)

  * libconfuse (available under http://www.nongnu.org/confuse/)

  * log4cpp (available under http://log4cpp.sourcforge.net/)

  * zlib (available under http://www.gzip.org/zlib/)


>> Compiling

To build and install fex from the extracted distribution do;

  $ ./configure
  $ make all
  $ make install
  


>> Platforms

fex is known to run on:

Linux


>> Recommendation

Before Running fexd as an daemon, test its configuration with the 
fexd -d -d -d command.

>> Warning

fex was carefully tested und runs in serveral productive environments. However you should
always backup your data regularly.
